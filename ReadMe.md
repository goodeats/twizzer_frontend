# What the F@$% am I Tweeting??

This is a static client scaffolded by Yeoman using JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX to reformat calls to a back-end server connected to Twitter's API.

Type in a user's handle and the last 20 tweets will be produced showing the created at date, text, picture (if there is one), retweets, and favorites.

This was fun to play around with Twitter's API and I look forward to more opportunities to do so.
